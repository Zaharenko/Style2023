# New css features that every layout designer should know in 2023
1. Container queries enable you to apply styles to an element based on the size of the element's container. If, for example, a container has less space available in the surrounding context, you can hide certain elements or use smaller fonts. Container queries are an alternative to media queries, which apply styles to elements based on viewport size or other device characteristics.

2. The @layer CSS at-rule is used to declare a cascade layer and can also be used to define the order of precedence in case of multiple cascade layers.

3. Container queries enable you to apply styles to an element based on the size of the element's container. If, for example, a container has less space available in the surrounding context, you can hide certain elements or use smaller fonts. Container queries are an alternative to media queries, which apply styles to elements based on viewport size or other device characteristics.

4. Avoid position absolute with a single cell CSS grid. Once they're piled on top of each other, use justify and align properties to position them.

5. Logical Properties: Logical properties allow for easier and more intuitive layout design by using terms like "start" and "end" instead of "left" and "right" that may be different in languages that are read from right to left.

6. There are lots of ways to make circles in CSS, but this is definitely the most minimal. The aspect-ratio CSS property sets a preferred aspect ratio for the box, which will be used in the calculation of auto sizes and some other layout functions.

7. CSS Scroll Snap is a module of CSS that contains features to control panning and scrolling behavior with snap positions.
